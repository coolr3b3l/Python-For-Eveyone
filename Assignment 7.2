# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:") : continue
    print(line)
print("Done")



Solution ------

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
average = 0
count = 0
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:") : continue
    pos = line.find(" ")
    val = line[pos:].strip()
    val = float(val)
    count = count + 1
    average = average + val
        
print ("Average spam confidence:", average/count)
